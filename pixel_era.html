                <h2>The Pixel Era: Foundations of Digital Vision</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Before the sophistication of modern rendering, computer graphics began in the "Pixel Era," a time
                    defined by limited processing power and memory. Early displays painted scenes one pixel at a time,
                    often
                    in monochrome or with a severely restricted color palette. This period saw the birth of iconic
                    arcade
                    games and early home console experiences, where creativity flourished within strict technical
                    constraints. Artists and programmers meticulously crafted every pixel to convey characters,
                    environments, and action, laying the fundamental groundwork for all digital visuals to come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the blocky sprites of classic arcade cabinets to the vibrant, yet abstract, worlds of early
                    8-bit
                    and 16-bit consoles, the Pixel Era emphasized strong visual design and imaginative interpretation.
                    Developers learned to convey depth and motion with clever use of color, simple animations, and
                    parallax
                    scrolling, proving that compelling visual experiences could be built from the simplest of digital
                    building blocks. This era cemented the core principles of raster graphics that still underpin much
                    of
                    modern display technology.
