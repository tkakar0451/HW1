                <h2>The 3D Era: A Leap into Immersive Dimensions</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The mid-1990s ushered in the revolutionary "3D Era," fundamentally transforming how digital worlds
                    were
                    perceived and interacted with. This period marked a dramatic shift from flat, sprite-based visuals
                    to
                    environments constructed from polygons, allowing for unprecedented depth, perspective, and freedom
                    of
                    movement. Early 3D graphics were characterized by visible polygonal edges and often muted textures,
                    but
                    the sheer novelty and potential for immersion captivated audiences, setting a new standard for
                    visual
                    fidelity in interactive experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key advancements during this era included the development of sophisticated 3D rendering pipelines,
                    texture mapping to add detail to polygons, and improved lighting models. Influential consoles and PC
                    hardware drove this evolution, enabling complex camera controls and dynamic environments. The
                    transition
                    to three dimensions didn't just enhance realism; it fundamentally reshaped game design, engineering,
                    and
                    visual storytelling, paving the way for the complex virtual worlds we inhabit today.
